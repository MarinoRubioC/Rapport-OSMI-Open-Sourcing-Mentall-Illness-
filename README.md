# Rapport-OSMI-Open-Sourcing-Mentall-Illness-
The dataset OSMI contains a database of attitudes toward mental health in the technology workplace occurring in 2016 (but also in 2014).
We are interested in assessing how mental health is perceived in the technology workplace.
The objective of this project is to develop a data storytelling to explain the different one-sided factors of mental illness in the workplace. 
But also, how do the frequencies of mental illness and mental health behaviors vary by geographic location? This project will rely primarily on Data Viz.
We will perform analysis and manipulation on the database to integrate graphs.
